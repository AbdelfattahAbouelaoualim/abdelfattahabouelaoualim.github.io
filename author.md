##### <span style="color:#5634DB">Machine Learning and Graph Theory</span>

With a strong academic background, which began at ENSIMAG where I gained skills in mathematics and computer science, and culminating with a doctorate in computer science from UNIVERSITÃ‰ PARIS-SACLAY, I am deeply passionate about the intersection of graphs, algorithms, and data engineering. My years of study allowed me to delve deeply into the world of graphs, operational research, and optimization. My tenure at TELECOM PARIS was particularly enriching, enabling me to specialize in Big Data, especially in areas like distributed systems, Big Data security, Cloud Computing, and most notably, graph databases.

Over my 16 years of experience across various industries, I dedicated 5 years to specializing in GCP, where I developed a keen interest in data engineering and data architecture. My role as a Senior Data Engineer GCP at SFEIR for the LE GALEC mission was a pivotal one, allowing me to migrate vast amounts of data to GCP and to develop advanced transformation models. Furthermore, as a Tech Lead GCP for the SERVIER mission, I worked on an innovative project transforming biomedical databases into Neo4j graphs, showcasing my expertise in using Graph Databases. My technical skills encompass a wide range of tools, languages, and systems, with a particular proficiency in Python and SQL languages, and deep expertise in GCP, BigQuery, Neo4j, and various orchestration and transformation tools. My dedication to data engineering and continuous innovation drives me to constantly explore new frontiers.
