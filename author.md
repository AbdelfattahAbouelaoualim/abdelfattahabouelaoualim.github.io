As a Senior Lead Architect, I specialize in designing and implementing innovative solutions that drive business transformation. With a robust foundation in enterprise architecture, evidenced by my TOGAF certification, I seamlessly integrate overarching business strategies with technology. My expertise extends deeply into the Google Cloud Platform, where I am certified as a Professional Cloud Architect, Data Engineer, ML Engineer, and DevOps Engineer. This diverse skill set allows me to architect, build, and optimize systems that are not only efficient but also scalable and future-proof.

I have had the privilege of studying at some of the world's leading institutions, each renowned for their excellence in technology and research. In 2020, I earned a Specialized Master's in Big Data from Télécom Paris, a founding member of the Institut Polytechnique de Paris (IP Paris). According to the QS World University Rankings by Subject 2021, Télécom Paris advanced to the 64th position globally in Computer Science, ranking fourth in France and 19th in Europe.

Prior to that, in 2007, I completed a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Université Paris-Saclay. This university has consistently improved its standing, achieving the 12th position worldwide and first in Continental Europe in the 2024 Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU).

Earlier, in 2003, I obtained a Master's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from ENSIMAG, part of Grenoble INP. Grenoble INP is recognized for its excellence in engineering and computer science, contributing to the reputation of Université Grenoble Alpes, which was ranked among the top 150 universities globally in the 2023 ARWU.

These academic experiences at top-tier institutions have been instrumental in shaping my expertise and commitment to excellence in the field of information technology.
