##### <span style="color:#5634DB">Machine Learning and Graph Theory</span>

I am interested in modern techniques that combine machine learning and graph theory: Graph Learning, Graph Embedding, Graph Representation, Spectral Graph Convolutions, Convolutional Graph Network, Knowledge Graph, NLP, Computer Vision,... The purpose of these techniques is to exploit the fact that often the data (texts, images,...) are linked. These techniques consist in making a first model of the problem in the form of a graph and then a second modeling in machine learning on the generated graph. Naturally, these techniques find their applications in the fields of:
- Human resources, 
- Social and organizational networks, 
- Telecommunications, 
- Transport, 
- Pharmaceutical industry, 
- Disease outbreak, 
- Recommender systems, 
- Financial markets, 
- Cybersecurity,
- ... 

More and more, data are becoming linked, which means that machine learning on graphs is the future of artificial intelligence.

##### <span style="color:#5634DB"> Cloud and Data architecture </span>

I am Togaf enterprise architect and certified in architecting Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure with Anthos. I have 13 years of experience in several industries and 4 years of academic research. In particular, I spent more than 8 years in the hardware department of [<span style="color:blue">Bull - Atos</span>](https://atos.net/en/solutions), the only manufacturer specializing in the design of [<span style="color:blue">supercomputers and data centers</span>](https://atos.net/en/solutions/high-performance-computing-hpc/bullsequana-x-supercomputers/bullsequana-x1000) in Europe. My knowledge of hardware, firmware and HPC (high performance computing) gives me a great ease with Big Data infrastructure (distributed architectures, on-prem or in the cloud: AWS, GCP, AZURE) and a very good knowledge of new parallelization and pipeline technologies for data and computing such as the [<span style="color:blue">Apache Foundation projects</span>](https://projects.apache.org/) (Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, Airflow...). With this experience and drawing inspiration from new Data Fabric concepts, I developed a very integrated vision of Data and Cloud architectures by addressing hardware, network, data engineering, machine learning applications, DevOps and FinOps issues.

##### <span style="color:#5634DB"> FinOps: DevOps and Corporate Finance </span>
FinOps is the new discipline mixing corporate finance and DevOps techniques to control the costs of cloud computing. Indeed, it is a global vision that focuses on the organization of IT teams in order to be able to measure and monitor the expenditure in terms of use of cloud computing by using prediction techniques such as time series or analysis of social networks and of course corporate finance. The goal is to find out when, why, how and by whom a penny is spent on cloud computing. I am interested in FinOps to allow companies to take full advantage of the great potential of cloud computing.
##### <span style="color:#5634DB"> Web Technologies and E-commerce </span>

I am also a fan of web technologies and e-commerce (it happened to me to create an e-commerce website). Due to my interest in the knowledge graph, I am also interested in the semantic web, ontology and taxonomy and graph database technologies in particular Neo4j and Cypher its query language and RDF query protocols such as SparQL. For my blogging activities I often used Html, Css and Flask. And for data science activities, I sometimes do web scrapping to increase and improve data, mainly using Beautifulsoup and Scrapy.
