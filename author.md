As a Senior Lead Architect, I specialize in designing and implementing innovative solutions that drive business transformation. With a robust foundation in enterprise architecture, evidenced by my TOGAF certification, I seamlessly integrate overarching business strategies with technology. My expertise extends deeply into the Google Cloud Platform, where I am certified as a Professional Cloud Architect, Data Engineer, ML Engineer, and DevOps Engineer. This diverse skill set allows me to architect, build, and optimize systems that are not only efficient but also scalable and future-proof.
