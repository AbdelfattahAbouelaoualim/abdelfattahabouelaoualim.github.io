##### <span style="color:#5634DB">Machine Learning and Graph Theory</span>

I specialize in modern techniques that combine machine learning and graph theory: Graph Learning, Graph Embedding, Graph Representation, Spectral Graph Convolutions, Convolutional Graph Network, Knowledge Graph, NLP, Computer Vision,... The purpose of these techniques is to exploit the fact that often the data (texts, images,...) are linked. These techniques consist in making a first model of the problem in the form of a graph and then a second modeling in machine learning on the generated graph. Naturally, these techniques find their applications in the fields of:
- Human resources, 
- Social and organizational networks, 
- Telecommunications, 
- Transport, 
- Pharmaceutical industry, 
- Disease outbreak, 
- Recommender systems, 
- Financial markets, 
- Cybersecurity,
- ... 

More and more, data are becoming linked, which means that machine learning on graphs is the future of artificial intelligence.

##### <span style="color:#5634DB"> Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure and Big Data Engineering </span>

I am certified as an architect in Hybrid Cloud Infrastructure with Anthos and have more than 11 years of experience in IT as an R&D engineer. In particular, I spent more than 8 years in the hardware department of [<span style="color:blue">Bull</span>](https://atos.net/en/solutions), the only manufacturer specializing in the design of [<span style="color:blue">supercomputers and data centers</span>](https://atos.net/en/solutions/high-performance-computing-hpc/bullsequana-x-supercomputers/bullsequana-x1000) in Europe. My knowledge of hardware, firmware and HPC (high performance computing) gives me a great ease with Big Data infrastructure (distributed architectures, on-prem or in the cloud: AWS, GCP, AZURE) and a very good knowledge of new parallelization and pipeline technologies for data and computing such as the Apache Foundation projects (Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, Airflow...)

##### <span style="color:#5634DB"> Web Technologies, E-commerce, Fintech and Corporate Finance </span>

I am also a fan of web technologies, scrapping, e-commerce and fintech. During my career, I have developed the ability to approach the technical and theoretical aspects of my work with a high degree of autonomy and have become comfortable collaborating with multi-disciplinary teams.

##### <span style="color:#5634DB"> Education </span>

- <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> International Certificate in Corporate Finance from [<span style="color:blue">HEC Paris business school</span>](https://www.hec.edu/en). 
- <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> Specialized Master's degree in "big data: management and analysis of massive data" from [<span style="color:blue">Télécom Paris</span>](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home) ([<span style="color:blue">Polytechnic Institute of Paris</span>](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en/home-en/)), best engineering school in digital technologies in France.
- <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> Ph.D. in graph theory from the [<span style="color:blue">University of Paris-Saclay</span>](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en). My thesis subject was to explore algorithmically and topologically the existence of patterns in edge-colored graphs. 
- <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> Master's degree in operational research, optimization and combinatorics from [<span style="color:blue">ENSIMAG</span>](http://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/en), one of the best engineering schools in computer science and applied mathematics in France.

On a personal note, I enjoy working in an international environment and staying up-to-date with developments in science and technology.
